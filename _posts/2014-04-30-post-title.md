Well. This site was, by uh the title, launched a number of years ago, but who knows what that date will finally do.
Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is just about as easy as the tutorial implied it would be.
